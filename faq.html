          <h3>How much does hybrid battery repair cost?</h3>
          <p>
            Costs depend on the model and the extent of damage. Basic
            repairs start at $699 and increase for more extensive services
            like complete rebuilds or new module replacements. These
            services offer an affordable alternative to full battery
            replacement.

        <div class="faq">
          <h3>What are the signs my hybrid battery needs replacement?</h3>
          <p>
            Watch for drops in fuel economy, dashboard warning lights,
            difficulty starting, unstable charge levels and unusual engine
            noises. These signs indicate the battery may need testing or
            replacement.

        <div class="faq">
          <h3>Does hybrid battery repair come with a warranty?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. We offer a range of warranty options, from a 3‑month basic
            warranty to a 3‑year plan with new modules. Our team can
            recommend the best coverage for your vehicle.

          <h3>How long do repairs take?</h3>
          <p>
            Most hybrid battery repairs and rebuilds are completed within
            one day. Complex jobs may take longer, but we always strive to
            minimize your vehicle’s downtime.

            don’t see your vehicle’s brand — chances are we can still
